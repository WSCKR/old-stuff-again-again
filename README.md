# Bromoscope

This is the official repository for the discord bot Bromoscope. It's written in javascript, though it was my first so it is kinda spaghetti code that I never really fixed. Here you can look at how I implemented all of the commands and such into the bot.

## Disclaimer

You can copy this code if you want to for some reason, but just know that I don't give you permission to copy literally everything about it. If you want to copy the code, then you at least need to know how it works, so you can change certain aspects of it so it isn't just a Bromoscope clone.

## How to use

In order to run the bot, all you need to do is open command prompt on Windows, change the directory so you can use the files using the command `cd [Directory]`, and then start the bot using `node bot.js`. Make sure you replace the token in the config.json file for your bot to connect. Just note, the bot logs all messages it can read in the textlog.log file and in the console so I can see when people try to talk to me through the bot (as that is a feature I included).

## Special thanks

People will be added here soon.
